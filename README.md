Collaborative Development Frack Hub Project


You need the app.py file and the templates folder with everything inside.
(I advise you create a python virtual enviroment for this; but it's not required.)

You need to install 4 packages:
- flask
- flask-login
- Flask-SQLAlchemy
- validators

*pip install [package]*

## Initial setup, take note of the administrator password in the console.
Account for admin is admin@frackhub.com, then the password displayed in console [If you lose it you need to delete then reinitialise the database.].
```
python set_up_database.py
```

## Done, now to run the actual app.
In a terminal, command prompt for windows, make sure you're in the same directory as the app.py file.
Then run it with python, for example:
```
python main.py
```
